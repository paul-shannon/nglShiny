     Phytochromes are red/far-red light photoreceptors that direct
     photosensory responses across the bacterial, fungal and plant
     kingdoms. These include photosynthetic potential and pigmentation
     in bacteria as well as chloroplast development and
     photomorphogenesis in plants. Phytochromes consist of an
     amino-terminal region that covalently binds a single bilin
     chromophore, followed by a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain
     that often transmits the light signal through a histidine kinase
     relay. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of the
     chromophore-binding domain of Deinococcus radiodurans phytochrome
     assembled with its chromophore biliverdin in the Pr ground
     state. Our model, refined to 2.5 A˚ resolution, reaffirms Cys 24
     as the chromophore attachment site, locates key amino acids that
     form a solvent-shielded bilin-binding pocket, and reveals an
     unusually formed deep trefoil knot that stabilizes this
     region. The structure provides the first three-dimensional
     glimpse into the photochromic behaviour of these photoreceptors
     and helps to explain the evolution of higher plant phytochromes
     from prokaryotic precursors.

     Phytochromes are a widespread family of red/far-red responsive
     photoreceptors first discovered in plants, where they constitute
     one of the three main classes of photomorphogenesis
     regulators. All phytochromes utilize covalently attached bilin
     chromophores that enable photoconversion between red-absorbing
     (Pr) and far-red-absorbing (Pfr) forms. Phytochromes are thus
     photoswitchable photosensors; canonical phytochromes have a
     conserved N-terminal photosensory core and a C-terminal
     regulatory region, which typically includes a
     histidine-kinase-related domain. The discovery of new bacterial
     and cyanobacterial members of the phytochrome family within the
     last decade has greatly aided biochemical and structural
     characterization of this family, with the first crystal structure
     of a bacteriophytochrome photosensory core appearing in
     2005. This structure and other recent biochemical studies have
     provided exciting new insights into the structure of
     phytochrome, the photoconversion process that is central to
     light sensing, and the mechanism of signal transfer by this
     important family of photoreceptors.

        Sensing and responding to light is a central feature of plant biology
        that is critical for tuning plant metabolism to the light
        environment. To accomplish this vital task, plants use a number of
        different photosensory proteins that perceive different bands of the
        electromagnetic spectrum. For sensing red light–depleted (shade) and red
        light–enriched (full sun) conditions, plants use phytochromes, large
        (120 kD) proteins that possess the covalently linked linear tetrapyrrole
        (bilin) chromophore phytochromobilin. First detected in 1959 by
        investigators at the USDA Plant Industry Station in Beltsville, MD,
        phytochromes share the characteristic that red light (R) irradiation
        converts the R-absorbing Pr state into the metastable, far-red light
        (FR)-absorbing Pfr state.  This photoconversion is reversible, with Pfr
        returning to Pr either upon absorption of an FR photon or upon prolonged
        incubation in the dark via a thermal process known as dark reversion. We
        now know that this reversible photochemistry reflects the unique
        environment of a bilin chromophore that is buried within a highly
        conserved N-terminal photosensory core region. Recently, Katrina Forest,
        together with Richard Vierstra and colleagues from the University of
        Wisconsin, captured a snapshot of the structure of the conserved
        photosensory core of a phytochrome, a result that has profound
        implications for the structural and functional basis of phytochrome
        signaling in plants.

      Light signals regulate a plethora of plant responses throughout their life
      cycle, especially the red and far-red regions of the light spectrum
      perceived by the phytochrome family of photoreceptors. However, the
      mechanisms by which phytochromes regulate gene expression and downstream
      responses remain elusive.

     Phytochromes are photoreceptors that provide plants with circadian, seasonal, and positional
     information critical for the control of germination, seedling development, shade avoidance,
     reproduction, dormancy, and sleep movements.
     <p>
     <p> Phytochromes are unique among photoreceptors in their capacity to interconvert between a
     red-absorbing form (absorption maximum of ∼<b>660</b> nm) and a far-red absorbing form
     (absorption maximum of ∼<b>730</b> nm), which occur in a dynamic equilibrium within plant
     cells, corresponding to the proportions of red and far-red energy in ambient light. Because
     pigments in stems and leaves absorb wavelengths <b>below about 700 nm</b>, this provides plants
     with an elegant system for detecting their position relative to other plants, with which the
     plants compete for light.

     <p>Certain aspects of phytochrome-mediated development
     outside of flowering plants are strikingly similar to those that have been characterized in
     Arabidopsis thaliana and other angiosperms. However, early diverging land plants have fewer
     distinct phytochrome gene lineages, suggesting that both diversification and
     subfunctionalization have been important in the evolution of the phytochrome gene family. There
     is evidence that subfunctionalization proceeded by the partitioning among paralogues of
     photosensory specificity, physiological response modes, and light-regulated gene expression and
       protein stability.

      <p>Parallel events of duplication and functional divergence may have coincided
     with the evolution of canopy shade and the increasing complexity of the light
     environment. Within angiosperms, patterns of functional divergence are clade-specific and the
     roles of phyto- chromes in A. thaliana change across environments, attesting to the
     evolutionary flexibility and contemporaneous plasticity of phytochrome signalling in the
     control of development.

      Plant photoreceptors link environmental light cues with physiological
      responses, determining how individual plants complete their life
      cycles. Structural and functional evolution of photoreceptors has
      co-occurred as plants diversified and faced the challenge of new light
      environments, during the transition of plants to land and as substantial
      plant canopies evolved. Large-scale comparative sequencing projects
      allow us for the first time to document photoreceptor evolution in
      understudied clades, revealing some surprises. Here we review recent
      progress in evolutionary studies of three photoreceptor families:
      phytochromes, phototropins and neochromes.

          Much of plant growth and development is regulated by the phytochrome
          (Phy) family of photoreceptors. We present an atomic perspective of
          plant Phy signaling through a crystal structure of the photosensing
          module as Pr from Arabidopsis PhyB assembled with its native
          chromophore phytochromobilin. Although its overall architecture and
          chromophore/protein contacts are reminiscent of bacterial relatives,
          significant structural differences are seen within the prominent
          knot, hairpin and helical spine features. Subsequent mutational
          analyses lend support to a toggle model for how Phys reversibly switch
          between their Pr and Pfr end states. This 3D structure along with
          the identified suite of photochemical variants should accelerate the
          rational redesign of Phy signaling for improved crop performance and
          optogenetic application.

        Plants are equipped with the capacity to respond to a large number of
        diverse signals, both internal ones and those emanating from the
        environment, that are critical to their survival and adaption as sessile
        organisms. These signals need to be integrated through highly structured
        intracellular networks to ensure coherent cellular responses, and in
        addition, spatiotemporal actions of hormones and peptides both
        orchestrate local cell differentiation and coordinate growth and
        physiology over long distances. Further, signal interactions and
        signaling outputs vary significantly with developmental context. This

         As they emerge from the ground, seedlings adopt a photosynthetic
         lifestyle, which is accompanied by dramatic changes in morphology and
         global alterations in gene expression that optimizes the plant body
         plan for light capture. Phytochromes are red and far-red photoreceptors
         that play a major role during photomorphogenesis, a complex
         developmental program that seedlings initiate when they first encounter
         light. The earliest phytochrome signaling events after excitation by
         red light include their rapid translocation from the cytoplasm to
         subnuclear bodies (“photobodies”) that also contain other proteins
         involved in photomorphogenesis, including a number of transcription
         factors and E3 ligases. In the light, phytochromes and negatively
         acting transcriptional regulators that interact directly with
         phytochromes are destabilized, whereas positively acting
         transcriptional regulators are stabilized. Here, we discuss recent
         advances on the mechanisms linking phytochrome photoactivation in the

        Phytochromes are red/far-red photoreceptors that play essential roles in diverse plant morphogenetic and
        physiological responses to light. Despite their functional significance, phytochrome diversity and evolution
        across photosynthetic eukaryotes remain poorly understood. Using newly available transcriptomic and genomic data
        we show that canonical plant phytochromes originated in a common ancestor of streptophytes (charophyte algae and
        land plants). Phytochromes in charophyte algae are structurally diverse, including canonical and non-canonical
        forms, whereas in land plants, phytochrome structure is highly conserved. Liverworts, hornworts and Selaginella
        apparently possess a single phytochrome, whereas independent gene duplications occurred within mosses, lycopods,
        ferns and seed plants, leading to diverse phytochrome families in these clades. Surprisingly, the phytochrome
        portions of algal and land plant neochromes, a chimera of phytochrome and phototropin, appear to share a common
        origin. Our results reveal novel phytochrome clades and establish the basis for understanding phytochrome
        functional evolution in land plants and their algal relatives.
