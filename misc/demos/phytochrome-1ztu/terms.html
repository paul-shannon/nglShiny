    <summary>biliverdin</summary>
  <h5>C33 H34 N4 O6</h5>
  <h5> Metabolism</h5>
  <image src="biliverdin.png">
  A green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment, a product of heme catabolism. It is the pigment responsible for a greenish
  color sometimes seen in bruises.

  Biliverdin results from the breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down
  senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin along with hemosiderin, in which biliverdin normally
  rapidly reduces to free bilirubin.

  Biliverdin is seen briefly in some bruises as a green color. In bruises, its breakdown into bilirubin leads to a
  yellowish color.

  <h5> Role in Disease</h5>

    Biliverdin has been found in excess in the blood of humans suffering from hepatic diseases. Jaundice is caused by
    the accumulation of biliverdin or bilirubin (or both) in the circulatory system and tissues.[1] Jaundiced skin and
    sclera (whites of the eyes) are characteristic of liver failure.

  <h5> Role in Treatment of Disease</h5>

   While typically regarded as a mere waste product of heme breakdown, evidence that suggests that biliverdin — and
   other bile pigments — has a physiological role in humans has been mounting.[4][5]

   Bile pigments such as biliverdin possess significant anti-mutagenic and antioxidant properties and therefore may
   fulfil a useful physiological function.[5] Biliverdin and bilirubin have been shown to be potent scavengers of
   peroxyl radicals.[4][5] They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   heterocyclic amines, and oxidants — all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher
   concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular
   disease.[4] It has been suggested that biliverdin — as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments — may function as an
   HIV-1 protease inhibitor[6] as well as having beneficial effects in asthma[5] though further research is needed to
   confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any
   disease.

  <h5> In non-human animals</h5>

    Biliverdin is an important pigment component in avian egg shells, especially blue and green shells. Blue egg shells
    have a significantly higher concentration of biliverdin than brown egg shells.[7]

    Research has shown that the biliverdin of egg shells is produced from the shell gland, rather than from the
    breakdown of erythrocytes in the blood stream,[citation needed] although there is no evidence that the sources of
    the material are neither tetrapyrroles nor free haem from the blood plasma.[clarification needed][citation needed]

    Along with its presence in avian egg shells, other studies have also shown that biliverdin is present in the
    blue-green blood of many marine fish, the blood of tobacco hornworm, the wings of moth and butterfly, the serum and
    eggs of frogs, and the placenta of dogs.[8] With dogs this can lead, in extremely rare cases, to the birth of
    puppies with green fur; however, the green colour fades out soon after birth.[9] In the garfish (Belone belone) and
    related species, the bones are bright green because of biliverdin.[citation needed]

    Biliverdin is also present in the green blood, muscles, bones, and mucosal lining of skinks of the genus
    Prasinohaema, found in New Guinea. It is uncertain whether this presence of biliverdin is an ecological or
    physiological adaptation of any kind. It has been suggested that accumulation of biliverdin might deter harmful
    infection by Plasmodium malaria parasites, although no statistically significant correlation has been
    established.[10] The Cambodian frog, Chiromantis samkosensis, also exhibits this characteristic along with turquoise
    bones.[11]

  <h5> In Fluorescense Imaging</h5>

   In a complex with reengineered bacterial phytochrome, biliverdin has been employed as an IR-emitting chromophore for
   in vivo imaging.[12][13] In contrast to fluorescent proteins which form their chromophore through posttranslational
   modifications of the polypeptide chain, phytochromes bind an external ligand (in this case, biliverdin), and
   successful imaging of the first bacteriophytochrome-based probe required addition of the exogenous biliverdin.[12]
   Recent studies demonstrated that bacteriophytochrome-based fluorescent proteins with high affinity to biliverdin can
   be imaged in vivo utilizing endogenous ligand only and, thus, with the same ease as the conventional fluorescent
   proteins.[13] Advent of the second and further generations of the biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome-based probes
   should broaden the possibilities for the non-invasive in vivo imaging.

  
  <h5>bilins</h5>
  Bilins, bilanes or bile pigments are biological pigments formed in many organisms as a metabolic product of certain
  porphyrins. Bilin (also called bilichrome) was named as a bile pigment of mammals, but can also be found in lower
  vertebrates, invertebrates, as well as red algae, green plants and cyanobacteria. Bilins can range in color from red,
  orange, yellow or brown to blue or green.

  In chemical terms, bilins are linear arrangements of four pyrrole rings (tetrapyrroles). In human metabolism,
  bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme. A modified bilane is an intermediate in the biosynthesis and
  uroporphyrinogen III from porphobilinogen (PBG).

  Examples of bilins are found in animals, and phycocyanobilin, the chromophore of the photosynthetic pigment
  phycocyanin in algae and plants. In plants, bilins also serve as the photopigments of the photoreceptor protein
  phytochrome. An example of an invertebrate bilin is micromatabilin, which is responsible for the green color of the
  Green Huntsman Spider, Micrommata virescens.

  <h5>bile</h5>

  Bile, or gall, is a dark-green-to-yellowish-brown fluid produced by the liver of most vertebrates that aids the
  digestion of lipids in the small intestine. In humans, bile is produced continuously by the liver (liver bile) and
  stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. After eating, this stored bile is discharged into the duodenum.

  The composition of hepatic bile is (97–98)% water, 0.7%[1] bile salts, 0.2% bilirubin, 0.51% fats (cholesterol, fatty
  acids, and lecithin),[1] and 200 meq/l inorganic salts.[2] The two main pigments of bile are bilirubin, which is
  orange–yellow, and its oxidised form biliverdin, which is green. When mixed, they are responsible for the brown color
  of feces.[3] About 400 to 800 millilitres of bile is produced per day in adult human beings.[4]

or conjugated protein, is an apoprotein combined with its prosthetic group.  A conjugated protein is a protein that
functions in interaction with other (non-polypeptide) chemical groups attached by covalent bonding or weak
interactions.

Some enzymes do not need additional components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called
cofactors to be bound for activity.

Many proteins contain only amino acids and no other chemical groups, and they are called simple proteins. However, other
kind of proteins yield, on hydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they are called
conjugated proteins. The non-amino part of a conjugated protein is usually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic
groups are formed from vitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified on the basis of the chemical nature of their
prosthetic groups.

Some examples of conjugated proteins are lipoproteins, glycoproteins, phosphoproteins, hemoproteins, flavoproteins,
metalloproteins, phytochromes, cytochromes, opsins and chromoproteins.

Hemoglobin contains the prosthetic group known as heme. Each heme group contains an iron ion (Fe2+) which forms a
co-ordinate bond with an oxygen molecule (O2), allowing hemoglobin to transport oxygen through the bloodstream. As each
of the four protein subunits of hemoglobin possesses its own prosthetic heme group, each hemoglobin can transport four
molecules of oxygen.

Glycoproteins are generally the largest and most abundant group of conjugated proteins. They range from glycoproteins in
cell surface membranes that constitute the glycocalyx, to important antibodies produced by leukocytes.
